	<h>FilTar - command line tool</tool>
		
	<p>This is a command-line instance of the FilTar tool. Its primary purpose is to provide tissue specific miRNA target prediction in animals. This is achieved by
integrating RNA-Seq data and existing, publicly available algorithms for miRNA target prediction - and allowing users to filter target predictions on the
basis of expression of mRNA transcripts within a given biological context (e.g. tissue or cell line).</p>
