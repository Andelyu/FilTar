# FilTar

FilTar is a tool to integrate RNA-Seq data to pre-existing miRNA target prediction workflows in order to increase prediction accuracy.

It achieves this by:

1. Removing transcripts which are not expressed or poorly expressed for a given cell type or tissue
2. Generating 3'UTR annotations specific to a given cell type or tissue

It also operates as a fully functional wrapper around the pre-existing TargetScan7 and miRanda target prediction workflows.

## Documentation

FilTar is fully documented at the following location: https://tbradley27.github.io/FilTar/

## Getting Help

In order to ensure your enquiries are seen by the most people possible who may be sharing your problem, it is best to share the problems that you are having publicly. The first port of call is to post questions on this github repositories 'issue' page. Alternatively, the biostars bioinformatics online forum (https://www.biostars.org/) can also be used to post questions in public. If using biostars, please make sure to use the 'filtar' tag when asking questions to notify me, so I can answer promptly. 

If this option doesn't work for whatever reason, I happen to accept correspondence via my academic email address: thomas.bradley@uea.ac.uk

## Reporting bugs, enhancements

Again, the issues page of this repository is the best place to post this.

## Contributions and Acknowledgements

Simox Moxon came up with the original idea and project proposal for FilTar. The FilTar concept was extended and developed further between Simon Moxon and Thomas Bradley through the course of the latter's BBSRC (Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council) PhD Studentship on the Norwich Research Park (NRP) Bioscience Doctoral Training Partnership (DTP) programme, when Thomas Bradley worked under the primary supervision of Simon Moxon initially predominantly at the Earlham Institute, and then later predominantly at the School of Biological Sciences, University of East Anglia.

Full acknowledgements can be found within the preprinted article associated with FilTar.
